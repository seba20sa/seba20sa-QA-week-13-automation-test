# Week 13 - Automation test 

**Version 1.0.0**
--
Performed an automation test using wdio, the test is simple: from the google URL we select the element for the search bar and enter an input value, the we enter 'wikipedia' as the value and just 'press enter' then we select the desired url as another element and perform a click on it. Finally we test that the url and title on the html document match the desired values.
